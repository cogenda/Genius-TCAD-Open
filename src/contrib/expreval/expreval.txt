ExprEval 3.x Help
-----------------

Introduction
------------
ExprEval 3.x is an expression evaluation library for C++.  It can take an
expression string, parse it, and evaluate it.  Several key features of ExprEval
include:

- Object Oriented.  ExprEval 3.x is a C++ library, where 2.x was a C library.
- POEM (Parse Once, Evaluate Many), the expression string is parsed on time.
  After that, it can be evaluated over and over many times.
- Seperation of objects.  By keeping the function and value lists seperate from
  the expression, the programmer can choose how to connect them.  Each
  expression may have a private value list, or several expressions can share
  a single value list.
- Fast variable lookup.  The variables and constants are stored as pointers in
  the parsed expression.  This means there is no need to search through a list
  for the value.  Additionally, applications can do the same.
- Custom functions.  An application can create custom functions for use by an
  expression.  Doing so is easy.
- Variable constants.  As the name suggests, a constant that is variable.  The
  expression can NOT change a constant, but the application can.

Syntax
------
Expression syntax is similar to what it may look like written on paper.  The
operators '+', '-', '*', '/', and '^', are the addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and exponent operators and the '=' operator is used to
assign to a variable.

    k = (x * x) + (y * y)

is the same as

    k = x ^ 2 + y ^ 2

Parentheses are used to group items in an expression and for the
arguments to a function.

    d = sqrt((x * x) + (y * y))

Semicolons are used to seperate expressions.  In this way, an expresion string
can contain more than one expression.  The result is the value of the last
expression.

    x = r * cos(d); y = r * sin(d)

Functions can take normal arguments and reference arguments.  Functions that
take reference arguments can modify the reference variable.  Constants can NOT
be passed by reference.  Also, normal and reference arguments can be mixed, as
long as the order is the same.  Commas(',') at a parentheses level of 0 are used
to seperate the arguments.  Reference parameters must be prefixed with an
ampersand('&').

    f(x, y, z, &a, &b, &c)

is the same as

    f(x, &a, y, &b, z, &c)

Additionally, some functions may take special data arguments.  These are
used specifically by the functions only.  They are passed with the at sign('@').
For functions that take special data arguments, be sure to use the same data
name only for parameters of the same data type.

    f(@data)

Anything that is a sub-expression is still an expression, and can be anything
that an expression can be.

    y = x = 0

    x = r * cos(r1 ; r2) ; y = (z ; r) * cos(r1 + sin(r2) ; r2)

Order of Operators
------------------
Within an expression, the order of operators is as follows.

1.  Parentheses
2.  Exponents, left to right
3.  Negation, right to left
4.  Multiplication/division, left to right
5.  Addition/subtration, left to right
6.  Assignment, right to left

The entire expression is actually parsed as a tree.  This expression will look
a little like this: (view with a fixed-width font)

    y = q = x + -z^-2^3 - 5 * (x + 2) * sin(x)

                                assign(y)
                                    |
                                assign(q)
                                    |
                                subtract
                ________________/       \_____________
               /                                      \
             add                                     multiply
          ___/ \___                             _____/      \_____
         /         \                           /                  \
    variable(x)    negate                  multiply             function(sin)
                      |                  __/      \___                |
                    power               /             \             variable(x)
                  __/   \___         value(5)        add
                 /          \                    ____/ \_____
              power       value(3)              /            \
           ___/   \___                     variable(x)     value(2)
          /           \
      variable(z)    negate
                        |
                     value(2)

Using ExprEval
--------------
To use ExprEval, just include 'expreval.h' in your program.  All the items are
under the 'ExprEval' namespace:

    #include "expreval.h"
    using namespace ExprEval;
    using namespace std;

Then, create the value and function lists, and initialize them as desired.

    ValueList vlist;
    FunctionLIst flist;

    vlist.AddDefaultValues();
    flist.AddDefaultFunctions();

Finally, create the expression and set it to use the values and functions.

    Expression e;
    e.SetValueList(&vlist);
    e.SetFunctionList(&flist);

Now the expression is ready to be parsed and evaluated.

    e.Parse("y=5");
    result = e.Evaluate();

User Abort
----------
It is possible that an evaluation can take a long amount of time or enter an
infinite loop, depending on the functions used and the expression.  To help
with this, an abort mechanism is introduced.  Every time 'Node::Evaluate' gets
called, it calls 'Expression::TestAbort', and then 'Node::DoEvaluate'.  Every so
often, 'Expression::TestAbort' will call 'Expression::DoTestAbort'.  If
'Expression::DoTestAbort' returns true, and exception is thrown indicating an
abort.

The reason a real test is not conducted each time by 'Expression::TestAbort' is
that it can dramatically slow down the expression evaluation, depending how an
abort is tested.  'Expression::SetTestAbortCount' controlls how many times
'Node::Evaluate' (and therefore 'Expression::TestAbort') gets called before a
real abort is tested by 'Expression::DoTestAbort'.

To add abort testing support, derive a new expression object and override
'Expression::DoTestAbort' as follows:

    class MyExpression : public Expression
        {
        public:
            MyExpression(bool *abort) { m_abort = abort; }

            bool DoTestAbort() { return *m_abort; }

        private:
            bool *m_abort;
        };

User Data
---------
If custom function need to access user data associated with an expression,
derive a class from the expression object that stores the user data.  Then,
access the expression from the function node by using the protected 'm_expr'.

class MyExpression : public Expression
    {
    public:
        MyExpression(void *userdata);
    };

class MyFunctionNode : public FunctionNode
    {
    public:
        ...

        double DoEvaluate() {  MyExpression *m = (MyExpression*)m_expr; ... }
    };


Identifiers
-----------
Functions, variables, and constants are accessed in the expression as
identifiers.  These identifiers follow a certain form by the parser:

- An identifier may consist of multiple parts, each seperated by a period('.')
- An identifier does not end in a period('.')
- Each part begins with a letter or underscore('_'), and may contain letters,
  digits, or underscores('_').

The parser recognizes the above as identifiers in an expression.  However, no
check is made when an application adds a function or value to the lists.  It is
up to the application to make sure it is named correct.

The following are valid identifiers:

    color1
    color1.red
    color2._rgb._red
    _x

The following are invalid identifiers

    1color
    color.4

Value Lists
-----------
Value lists store the constants and values that are used by an expression.
A value list is associated with an expression by using 'Expression::SetValueList'
Once an expression is parsed, the expression tree stores pointers directly to
the values, and so the value list should not be freed while it is in use.

To add values to the list, use 'Add'.  You can also specify the
default values and if it is a constant.

    vlist.Add("x");
    vlist.Add("found", 1.0);
    vlist.Add("PI", 3.14159, true);

You can also add external values to the list as follows.

    double x, f, p;
    vlist.AddAddress("x", &x);
    vlist.AddAddress("f", &f, 2.2);
    vlist.AddAddress("p", &p, 3.14, true);

Sometimes a compiler may optimize code in such a way that problems occur.  For
instance, the expression can change the values 'x' and 'f' above, but the code
below may get optimized:

    x = 1;
    f = 2.2;

    for(...)
        {
        for(...)
            {
            e.Evaluate();
            Use(x, f);
            }
        }

Since it does not appear that 'x' and 'f' are being modified inside the loop,
especially in deeply nested loops, the compiler may optimize it by loading the
values outside the loop and using the cached values in the loop.  If the
expression changes the values, they will not be used, but the cached values
will be.  This is just a problem I have encounted a few times.  To solve this
problem, change their declarations to be volatile:

    volatile double x, f, p;
    vlist.AddAddress("x", (double*)&x);
    vlist.AddAddress("f", (double*)&f, 2.2);
    vlist.AddAddress("p", (double*)&p, 3.14, true);

Like this, the compiler must reload the variables from memory each time they
are accessed.

If you use internal storage, you can still get the address of the values and
directly manipulate them as such:

    double *x;

    vlist.Add("x");
    x = vlist.GetAddress("x");

    for(...)
        {
        *x = some_value;
        e.Evaluate();
        ...
        }

To initialize default values into the list, use 'AddDefaultValues':

    vlist.AddDefaultValues();
    vlist.Add("x");
    vlist.Add("y");
    ...

When you want to reset all items to their default values, you can call 'Reset'.
This will reset internal and external values.  Constants will also be reset
because, even though an expression can not modify a constant, the application
can.

    vlist.Reset();

You can also clear all items from the list.  Do this ONLY when the expression
will not be evaluated again or will be reparsed before evaluating, because the
expression stores pointers directly to the values, and evaluating the expression
if the list is cleared will likely cause an access violation.  External values
will not be deleted or removed, but the list entry associated with it will be.

    vlist.Clear();
    e.Parse(...);

Finally, you can save the state of the value list by enumerating the values:

    ValueList::size_type p, c;

    c = vlist.Count();
    for(p = 0; p < c; p++)
        {
        string name;
        double value;

        vlist.Item(p, &name, &value);
        ...
        }

You can later use this to restore the list.  Remember, when adding a value to
the list, if it already exists, an exception will the be thrown.

Function Lists
--------------
Function lists store the function factories for the expression.  A function
factory create a function node when needed, and also reports the name used.
To create a custom function, first derive a custom function node from
'FunctionNode'.

    class MyFunctionNode : public FunctionNode
        {
        public:
            MyFunctionNode(Expression *expr);
            double DoEvaluate();
        };

Set the argument count in the constructor.  The first two arguments control
the number of normal paramters, the second control the number of reference
parameters.  A value of -1 is used for any number.

    MyFunctionNode::MyFunctionNode(Expression *expr) : FunctionNode(expr)
        {
        SetArgumentCount(
            0, // Minimum normal parameters
            2, // Maximum normal parameters
            2, // Minimum reference parameters
            -1); // Maximum reference parameters
        }

Evaluate a function by overriding 'DoEvaluate'.  You can access the normal
parameters in 'm_nodes' and the reference parameters in 'm_refs' as follows.
When evaluating a node, call 'Evaluate' and NOT 'DoEvaluate'.

    double MyFunctionNode::DoEvaluate()
        {
        *m_refs[0] = m_nodes[0]->Evalute();

        return m_nodes[1]->Evaluate();
        }

It is up to each function solver how to access and do the job.  If you need to
iterate over the items, the types are defined as follows:

    std::vector<Node*> - For normal argumnents
    std::vector<double*> - For reference arguments

After a function node is created, a function factory must be created to produce
the function node:

    class MyFunctionFactory : public FunctionFactory
        {
        public:
            std::string GetName() const;
            FunctionNode *DoCreate(Expression *expr);
        };

    std::string MyFunctionFactory::GetName() const
        {
        return "myfunction";
        }

    FunctionNode *MyFunctionFactory::DoCreate(Expression *expr)
        {
        return new MyFunctionNode(expr);
        }

Finally, the function node needs to be added to function list:

    flist.Add(new MyFunctionFactory());

To be exception safe, you can also do this:

    auto_ptr<FunctionFactory> p(new MyFunctionFactory());
    flist.Add(p.get());
    p.release();

This way, if 'Add' throws an exception, the function factory will still
be deleted.

The library includes many internal functions.  These can be initialized directly
into the list:

    flist.AddDefaultFunctions();

And finally, you can clear the list if you want to.  The list is automatically
cleared when it is destroyed.

    flist.Clear();

Data Lists
----------
Data lists make it possible for arbitrary data to be passed from one function
to another.  Each function can register a number of arguments, and can specify
a number of data arguments.  The 'm_data' member of 'FunctionNode' contains
a list of pointers to 'DataEnty' items.  The 'SetData' and 'GetData' members
can be used to set and get data, which must derive from 'Data'. Also,
'Data::GetID' can be used to get the type of data.  The same data name should
only be passed to functions as parameters of the same data type.

    class MyData : public Data
        {
        public:
            long GetType() const
                {
                return CreateType('D', 'A', 'T', 'A');
                }

            void Action()
                {
                ...
                }
        };

    class MyFunctionNode : public FunctionNode
        {
        public:
            MyFunctionNode(...) : ...
                {
                SetArgumentCount(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1);
                }

            double DoEvaluate()
                {
                Data *d = m_data[0]->GetDataEntry();

                if(d)
                    {
                    // Verify type
                    if(d->GetType() != CreateType('D', 'A', 'T', 'A'))
                        throw(InvalidDataException(GetName());
                    else
                        ((MyData*)d)->Action();
                    }
                else
                    {
                    m_data[0]->SetData(new MyData());
                    }

                return 0.0;
                }
        };

The function may be called something like this:

    myfunc(@a);

Now, the data object 'a' is being passed as a data parameter to myfunc
that expects the to be of type 'DATA', so it should only be passed
as parameters that are of a type of 'DATA' and as parameters of other
types.  This rule can be broken, depending on the implementation of the
functions, but probably should not be.

The data object is deleted when the data list is destroyed.  Additionally,
the functions may set and delete the data object as it chooses.

    initdata(@a); dosomething(@a); deletedata(@a);

Expressions
-----------
The expression is what is used to actually parse and evaluate.  After the
function and value lists are created, they can be associated with an expression:

    Expression e;
    e.SetValueList(&vlist);
    e.SetFunctionList(&flist);
    e.SetDataList(&dlist);

An expression can be parsed and used over and over:

    e.Parse(...);

    for(...)
        {
        result = e.Evaluate();
        }

An expression can be parsed again, it is automatically cleared each time.
'Clear' can be called if desired to clear the expression without reparsing or
destroying it.

    e.Parse(...);

    for(...)
        {
        result = e.Evaluate();
        }

    e.Parse(...); // Automatically clears

    for(...)
        {
        ...
        }

    e.Clear(); // Clear expression, maybe to free memory, without destroying it

Exceptions
----------
Exceptions are thrown to indicate a problem.  The problem may or may not be
an error, depending on the exception, and the application.

Most exceptions are defined by ExprEval, but some exceptions may occur from
C++.  The most likely exception to get from C++ is 'bad_alloc' if memory
allocation fails.

ExprEval defines a base exception class 'Exception', which is derived from
'std::exception'.  All other ExprEval exceptiosn derive from it.

Exception

    Base ExprEval exception, derived from 'std::exception'.  A 'GetValue'
    method returns the string of where the exception came from, depending
    on the exception type.

    For some exceptions generated during parsing, A 'GetStart' and 'GetEnd'
    method return the position in the expression string of the start and
    end of the error.

NotFoundException (parsing)

    Thrown when a function is not found.  It is also thrown when a value
    identifer can not be found in a value list and can not be added to the
    list during a parse, but this will usually not happen because if it
    can not be added to the list, a 'bad_alloc' will usually be the reason.
    'ValueList::GetAddress' does not throw this.

AlreadyExistsException

    A name being added to a function or value list already exists.

NullPointerException

    A null pointer was passed to a function that should not be null.

MathException (evaluation)

    A math error occured during an evaluation.

DivideByZeroException (evaluation)

    A division by zero was attempted during evaluation.

NoValueListException (parsing)

    An expression is trying to use a value identifier, but no value list
    is associated with it.

NoFunctionListException (parsing)

    An expression is trying to use a function identifier, but no value list
    is associated with it.

AbortException (evaluation)

    'Expression::DoTestAbort' returned true.

EmptyExpressionException (parsing, evaluation)

    At parse time, there is no expression.  At evaluation time, the expression
    is not parsed.

UnknownTokenException (parsing)

    An unknown token was encounted.

InvalidArgumentCountException (parsing, evaluation)

    An invalid count of arguments was passed to a function.  At parse time, this
    is controlled by 'FunctionNode::SetArgumentCount'.  Some functions may take
    various parameter counts depending on a situation, and may throw this at
    evaluation time.

ConstantAssignException (parsing)

    An attempt to assign to a constant occured.

ConstantReferenceException (parsing)

    An attempt to pass a constant to a function by reference occured.

SyntaxException (parsing)

    A general syntax exception occured

UnmatchedParenthesisException (parsing)

    The parenthesis are unmatched or missing the opening or closing parenthesis.


Tricks
------

A single value list can be shared by more than one expression.  In this way, each
expression shares all values of that list:

    ValueList vlist;
    Expression e1, e2;

    e1.SetValueList(&vlist);
    e2.SetValueLIst(&vlist);

An external value can be shared by several value lists, and can be constant in
one and not in another:

    double x;
    ValueList v1, v2;
    Expression e1, e2;

    v1.AddAddress("x", &x);
    v2.AddAddress("x", &x, 0.0, true);

    e1.SetValueList(&v1);
    e2.SetValueList(&v2);

An empty expression can be ignored:

    Expression e1, e2;
    bool eval2;

    // Expression 1 must exist
    e1.Parse(...);

    // Expression 2 can be blank
    eval2 = true;
    try
        {
        e2.Parse(...);
        }
    catch(EmptyExpresionExceptin &e)
        {
        eval2 = false;
        }

    for(...)
        {
        e1.Evaluate();

        if(eval2)
            e2.Evaluate();
        }


Internal Values
---------------
A call to 'ValueList::AddDefaultValues' will add the following values to a
value list:

PI

    The value of PI, equal to 3.14159265358979323846

E

    The value of e, equal to 2.7182818284590452354


Internal Functions
